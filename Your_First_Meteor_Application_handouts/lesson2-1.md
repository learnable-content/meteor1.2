# Getting Started

Since we're not in the same room, I can't be sure of what you do or don't know about building web applications. Because of this, I'm going to assume a couple of things in this chapter:

* You have never operated a computer with the command line.
* You have not installed Meteor on your computer.

If both of these assumptions are wrong, feel free to skip this chapter, otherwise continue reading.

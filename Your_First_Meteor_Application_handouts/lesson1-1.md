# Introduction

This course on building your first Meteor.js application is designed for complete beginners, meaning you won't need any prior experience with Meteor or with building web applications. You will however, need a basic understanding of JavaScript: being familiar with variables, loops, conditionals and functions. You will also need a basic understanding of databases' concepts: tables, rows, columns, and primary keys. Still, we'll be moving nice and slow, so there's a decent chance that any missing pieces will become clearer.

# Items you'll need

For this course you will need:

* A computer with a major operating system: Mac, Windows, or Linux.
* A text editor. Sublime Text is an excellent option for most developers, but you can use whatever editor you prefer.
* A modern web browser. Google Chrome is the best option since it has a number of useful features for development, and it's what we'll be using throughout this course.
